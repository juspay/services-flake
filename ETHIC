# Hackers' Ethic

This Code of Ethics outlines core values guiding our conduct and decisions, prioritizing individual rights and collaborative continuity.

This framework is open to revisions that align with its aims and enhance our common understanding.

## Ethos

Guided by respect, autonomy, integrity, curiosity, and pragmatism, we challenge the status quo to solve real-world problems.

We forge and promote processes and tools which ensure ethical innovation for hackers _and_ humans alike.

Any who embrace this vision are welcome, uniting in pursuit of joint progress and freedom.
